						<h1>Men's Health</h1>
						<p>​Libido can be a scary word for us men, erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation are phrases we don’t want to have to deal with. Men are much less likely to seek medical advice and emotional support than women and that’s a fact.  
						Many men prefer to research their ailments and health issues online. </p>

						<h2>What this is about</h2>
						<p>In this section I would like to offer information that will be helpful to men, it is not aimed at diagnosis, as only a Doctor can make a diagnosis on matters relating to medical health, but I do understand that seeking medical attention for some conditions can be difficult and embarrassing for a lot of men.</p>
						<p>Online counselling service is completely confidential and because it is online, there is no possibility of embarrassment or additional stress. You can talk to a counsellor anonymously and from the comfort of your own home or work place right now.</p>

						<h3>Myth Busting information about your manhood.</h3>
						<p>The penis, as you are no doubt aware, is used for urinating, making babies, masturbating and generally having fun with. </p>
						<h3>What is the Penis, cock, tool or old man made of?</h3>
						<p>The penis is basically three cylinders of spongy erectile tissue full of blood vessels. The urethra, the body’s outlet tube for both sperm and urine (although only one at a time), passes through the middle of the smallest of these – the Corpus Spongiosum – which is found on the underside of the penis. 
						The corpus spongiosum expands at the tip to form the head of the penis called the glans. The glans is protected by the foreskin.</p>

						<h2>Men's Health Issues<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
						<h3>Why is my Erect Penis or Hard On bent?</h3>
						<p>Every penis is bit bent and a slight bend upwards is normal. You may have a problem if your penis is bent to the left or right so much as to make it difficult or even painful to enter your partner during sex.
						It could be condition called Peyronie’s. Bent penis's are very, very common and generally do not cause any problem with intercourse.</p>

						<h2>Erectile Dysfunction<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
						<h3>What Is It?</h3>
						<p>Impotence means that a man’s penis doesn’t get hard enough to have sexual intercourse. The man cannot get or maintain an erection. The medical term is erectile dysfunction. 
						Erectile dysfunction is not the same as premature ejaculation, which is ejaculating within 2 minutes after starting intercourse.</p>
						<h3>The major cause of erectile dysfunction is Vascular (blood vessel) disease.</h3>
						<p>Erections happen when blood collects in the shaft of the penis. Vascular disease can limit the amount of blood flowing to the penis or the amount staying in the penis. 
						Both can result in problems with erections. Blood vessels can be damaged by hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) or trauma. Vascular disease is believed to be the most common medical cause of impotence.</p>

						<h2>Erectile Dysfunction<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
						<h3>Nerve Damage (neuropathy)</h3>
						<p>Nerves must be working normally for a man to get and keep an erection. Nerves can be damaged by diabetes, multiple sclerosis, prostate surgery or damage to the spinal cord.</p>
						<h3>Psychological Factors</h3>
						<p>Psychological issues such as depression, anxiety, guilt or fear can sometimes cause sexual problems. A sudden loss of sexual appetite can also be as a result of psychological issues.
						At one time, these factors were thought to be the major cause of impotence. Doctors now know that physical factors cause impotence in most men with the problem. 
						However, embarrassment or “performance anxiety” can make a physical problem worse. </p>

						<h2>Erectile Dysfunction<b class="pull-right">(3)</b></h2>
						<h3>Medications</h3>
						<p>Many medications cause problems with sexual functioning, including drugs for high blood pressure, depression, heart disease and prostate cancer.</p>
						<h3>Hormonal Problems</h3>
						<p>Abnormal levels of certain hormones, such as testosterone, thyroid hormone and a pituitary hormone known as prolactin, can interfere with erections and sex drive (libido). This is an uncommon cause of impotence.</p>

						<h2>Erectile Dysfunction<b class="pull-right">(4)</b></h2>
						<h3>Symptoms</h3>
						<p>A man with impotence has either a problem getting an erection or difficulty maintaining one. This usually interferes with sexual activity. Impotence can happen suddenly or gradually. 
						Some men slowly lose the firmness of their erections or how long the erections last. In other men, especially those whose impotence is largely caused by psychological factors, the problem may occur unpredictably and can improve at any time. 
						Despite their difficulties with erections, men with impotence may continue to have normal orgasm and ejaculation without a full erection.</p>
						<h3>Treatment</h3>
						<p>Psychological therapy such as counselling, behavioural therapy or couples’ therapy can be effective in men whose impotence is caused primarily by psychological factors. 
						Online Counselling can help to reduce the embarrassment by offering anonymity to the client. You do not even have to give your real name. The sessions are confidential and secure online. </p>

						<h2>Premature ejaculation</h2>
						<p>This is when a man ejaculates (comes) within two minutes of penetration. It is more common amongst younger men up to the age of 35. It tends to happen because a man is very aroused.
						You can see your GP and or talk to a Counsellor for confidential help.</p>
						<h3>What causes it?</h3>
						<p>Either just being very excited with a new partner, or an acute sensitivity of the local nervous system, which triggers orgasm too quickly.</p>

						<h2>Viagra, what’s the score?</h2>
						<p>Tablet form work by increasing the flow of blood to the penis, giving a harder, longer lasting hard-on. Effects last around four hours.</p>
						<h3>Sex on Viagra</h3>
						<p>Erection drugs don’t make you horny or cause instant hard-ons. They only start working after you get turned on (aroused). Some men say their hard-ons have less feeling and that coming is more difficult, but that after they have come they can get hard again quicker.</p>

						<h2>The prostate<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
						<h3>What is a prostate and why do men need it?</h3>
						<p>The prostate is the gland that is part of the male reproductive system. It is shaped like a walnut and is about 1.2 inches across. One of its functions is to make one of the ingredients of semen, the fluid produced during ejaculation. </p>
						<h3>What is Prostate Cancer?</h3>
						<p>Prostate cancer occurs when the cells within the prostate grow uncontrollably, creating small tumours. The term “cancer” refers to a condition in which the regulation or balance of cell growth is lost and cells grow uncontrollably. 
						Most cells in the body are constantly dividing, maturing and then dying in a perfectly controlled process. </p>
						<p>Unlike normal cell growth, the growth of cancer cells is no longer regulated correctly. Instead of dying as they should, cancer cells outlive normal cells and continue to form new, abnormal cells.
						In most cases, prostate cancer is a relatively slow-growing cancer, </p>

						<h2>The prostate<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
						<h3>How curable is prostate cancer?</h3>
						<p>Because approximately 90% of all prostate cancers are detected in the local and regional stages, the cure rate for prostate cancer is very high nearly 100% of men diagnosed at this stage will be disease-free after five years.
						As with any illness or condition, early detection offers the best chance of a successful treatment. A Prostate examination is not as bad as it can sometimes sound. </p>

						<h3>What happens during a prostate exam?</h3>
						<p>A doctor or Physician will ask you to lie on your side, he will wear a surgical glove with a water based lubricant and insert one finger into your anus, he will be able to feel the Prostate and make a diagnosis. 
						This whole process will take no longer than a minute, and could save your life. So get it checked out.</p>
						<p>If you are worried and would like to talk to a counsellor online, in complete confidence, you don’t even need to give your real name, no-one will ever know you are seeking help and no records are kept of our chats.
						I am an experienced, professional online counsellor, with over 13 years’ experience working as a counsellor (therapist) offering confidential, affordable counselling online to clients anywhere in the world.</p>
						<p>By working from home I have reduced my costs enabling me to reduce the session fees for clients, making counselling online more accessible to people seeking counselling online.
						I have helped many men who struggle with talking about private and sometimes, embarrassing issues.</p>
