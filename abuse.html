						<h1>Abuse</h1>
						<p>​Abuse comes in many forms, Sexual, Physical, Financial, Emotional, Domestic Abuse, Neglect and Bullying, at home or at work. Sometimes, we may not feel we’re being abused because it may have happened gradually and usually by people who are close to us or troubled and may have issues themselves. If you or someone you love is effected by abuse, then abuse counselling will help.</p>
						<p>Most abuse happens because the abuser takes away our control, if it’s a secret then they hold all the power. To stop abuse we must speak out, if we speak out, even if we only tell one other person who we can trust, we start to take back some control, this is the beginning of recovery from abuse. Find someone you can trust and talk to them about what is happening, do it today and take some control back in your life, abuse counselling will help you regain that control.</p>
						<p>Online abuse counselling is very accessible to people who are controlled as it can be accessed from the safety of your own home or work place.</p>

					<h2>Emotional Abuse</h2>
					<p>Is when someone threatens or humiliates you. This includes calling you names, putting you down, insulting you, or breaking your things.</p>
					<p>Control is a huge part of emotional abuse and involves anger, jealousy, accusations, and distrust. This type of abuse is the hardest to spot because the injuries are not physical or visible. Emotional abuse can be mistaken for passionate or intense love. 
					Abusive relationships don’t always involve physical violence, but it is very damaging. Emotional abuse can be damaging to our self worth and abuse counselling is a must.</p>

					<h2>Bullying</h2>
					<p>Is the act of intentionally causing harm to others, through verbal harassment, physical assault, or other more subtle methods of intimidation such as manipulation. Bullying can be defined in many different ways.</p>
					<p>Bullying is usually done to intimidate others by fear or threat. Bullying in school and the workplace is also referred to as peer abuse, if you see bullying in any form, please tell someone in authority and have it recorded, anonymously if need be.</p>

					<h2>Financial Abuse</h2>
					<p>Is one of the forms of abuse more common in couples who live together, maybe your partner gives you just enough money to pay the things he/she entrusts you with, or maybe they don’t give you access to any money and they control every aspect of finances. </p>
					<p>This is a form of control, removing your options of escape or having any kind of life of your own. 
					Financial abuse often goes hand in hand with other forms of abuse, particularly physical and emotional abuse, combined, they are often referred to as Domestic Abuse, Domestic Violence or Partner Abuse.</p>
					<p>Get help; the sooner the better because online abuse counselling works.</p>

					<h2>Partner abuse, domestic violence &amp; domestic abuse<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
					<p>Partner abuse, domestic violence, domestic abuse, are all words which will create misery in any relationship. Feeling trapped and alone as abused partners often do, it can be difficult to know who to turn to. Online counselling is ideal for that reason.</p>
					<h3>What is partner abuse?</h3>
					<p>There are a number of different definitions of partner abuse. In Women’s Aid’s view, partner abuse could be physical abuse, psychological abuse, sexual abuse or financial abuse that may, but not always occur in the home between people in an intimate or family type relationship and forms a pattern of coercive and or controlling behaviour.</p>
					<p>This can include forced marriage and so-called ‘Honour’ crimes. Partner abuse often includes a range of abusive behaviours, not all of which are, in themselves, inherently ‘Violent’ hence some people prefer to use the term ‘Domestic Abuse’ rather than ‘Domestic Violence’</p>

					<h2>Partner abuse, domestic violence &amp; domestic abuse<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
					<h3>Whatever you call it, it is wrong</h3>
					<p>Confidential online therapy is very effective in supporting domestic abuse or domestic violence survivors as it is easily accessible without alerting the abuser that a victim is seeking help and support.
					I am an experienced, professional online counsellor, with over 13 years experience working as a counsellor (therapist) offering confidential, affordable counselling online to clients anywhere in the world.
					By working from home I have reduced my costs enabling me to reduce the session fees for clients, making counselling online more accessible to people seeking counselling online.</p>
					<p>I have worked in the field of partner abuse , domestic violence/abuse counselling, family abuse counselling and therapy for several years both face to face and online counselling.
					I can also help people to choose better partners and to identify problematic behaviours before they become an issue. It is never the fault of the survivor when abusive relationships occur but there is a lot to be gained from learning to identify an abusive behaviour before we get involved.
					If you have suffered abuse of any type, what is important for us is to find someone you can trust, abuse shatters trust, so this can be difficult.</p>

					<h2>Abuse counselling</h2>
					<p>Often when one form of abuse exists, others do too. If you have been, or are being abused in some way, you may generally have less social support than other people, making the abuser’s task easier and you more isolated. Isolation is a major contributory factor for many forms of abuse.</p>
					<p>If a person is staying at home, either too frightened to go out, or unable to for some reason, he/she becomes much more of a victim of abuse and trapped. Tell someone what is happening, when it is safe to talk to, do it today!</p>
					<p>When someone is being abused in any way, what is important is to get it to stop and to help the person being abused to feel safe. This sounds simple, but it is not. 
					One of the first things that needs to be done to help the person being hurt is that they find someone that they can trust unconditionally. Finding such a person is extremely difficult.</p>
					<p>I am here to support and listen to the facts and help the person being abused to explore their options, look at strategies for staying as safe as possible and to work at the pace of the person being abused. 
					No matter how isolated you feel, I am here and able to help, abuse counselling is effective and at your pace.</p>
